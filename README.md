ESP32-based Home Energy Monitor: monitors electricity consumption of your entire house with a single CT sensor.

## Structure

This project consists out of multiple components:

| Folder            | Description         | Build status | 
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | 
| `src-esp32`       | Firmware for the ESP32 (measuring device) | ![Firmware Build Status](https://github.com/Savjee/home-energy-monitor/workflows/firmware/badge.svg) |

(TODO: add instructions on how to deploy all of this. üòÖ)

## Cloud Architecture

This is the cloud architecture that powers the energy meter and the app:

![AWS Cloud Architecture](https://savjee.github.io/home-energy-monitor/readme-images/architecture.png)

In a nutshell:
* The ESP32 has a MQTT connection
* Every 30 seconds, 30 measurements are sent to Home assistant

## DIY Requirements

To build your own Energy Monitor you need the following hardware:

* ESP32
* CT sensor: YHDC SCT-013-030 (30A/1V)
* 10¬µF capacitor
* 2 resistors (between 10k-470k‚Ñ¶)

Other requirements:
* Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) on your system
* Drivers for your ESP32 board
